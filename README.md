# Asthma-Pregnancy Disparities Research Initiative

## Core Mission
Our mission is to investigate the structural and social determinants that lead to asthma management disparities in pregnant Black women, with the goal of identifying actionable interventions to improve maternal health outcomes.

## Primary Research Question
What are the key structural and social determinants contributing to disparities in asthma management and outcomes among pregnant Black women, and how can healthcare systems address these inequities?
